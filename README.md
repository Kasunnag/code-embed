# Code Embed

Code Embed allows you to embed code – JavaScript and HTML primarily – in a post. This is incredibly useful for embedding video, etc, when required and is used, amongst other, by Mozilla.

It cannot be used for server side code, such as PHP.

Features include...
* Add HTML or JavaScript to posts or pages – particularly useful for embedding videos!
* Embed in widgets using the Widget Logic plugin
* Global embedding allows you set up some code in one post or page and then access it from another
* Modify the keywords or identifiers used for embedding the code to your own choice
* Search for embedding code via a simple search option
* Add a simple suffix to the embed code to convert videos to responsive output
* Embed an external script directly using just the URL
